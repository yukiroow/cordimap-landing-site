          The region is predominantly characterized by high elevation terrain. It has over a hundred peaks,

          meters or more above sea level; this is predominant in the provinces of Benguet and Mt. Province. This 
          generally gives the cool temperate climate of these provinces. Only 40% of its lowland areas are on elevations

         CAR lies in a seismically active region of the Philippine archipelago making human habitation in certain areas vulnerable to earthquake hazards. 
         The region attributes its seismicity to the active faults along the branches of the northern segments of the Philippine Fault Zone such as the Digdig 
         Fault and the active subduction along the Manila Trench. The devastating earthquake of July 1990 was believed to have originated from the Digdig Fault.
