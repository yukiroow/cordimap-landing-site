                Luzon is traversed by the Central Cordillera and Northern Sierra Madre Mountain ranges.

                marine sediments. In addition, Tertiary volcanic and metamorphosed basement units are 
                also present. Sedimentary basins between uplifts make up the remainder of Luzon.

                CAR lies in a seismically active region of the Philippine archipelago making human 
                habitation in certain areas vulnerable to earthquake hazards. The region attributes its 
                seismicity to the active faults along the branches of the northern segments of the Philippine 
                Fault Zone such as the Digdig Fault and the active subduction along the Manila Trench. The 
                devastating earthquake of July 1990 was believed to have originated from the Digdig Fault.

                The region is known for its very cool climate which is mainly due to its high mean elevation. 
                It is governed by two (2) climatic type where Type I (red) covers about 64% and Type III (white) 
                covers 33% of the total area.Type I is characterized by two (2) pronounced seasons: dry season 
                from November to April and wet season for the rest of the year.The provinces that fall under 
                this type are Benguet including Baguio City; eastern part of Abra, Ifugao and Mountain Province.
                Type III has no pronounced maximum rain period with a short dry season lasting only from one to 
                three months.
