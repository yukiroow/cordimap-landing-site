            CARâ€™s Biodiversity is constantly threatened with undue pressure from
            human activities such as timber poaching and forest lands conversion
            to agricultural use, among others, that are inimical to the
            intrinsic requirement for biodiversity and its sustainable
            existence. The abundance, distribution and degree of threat to which
            these resources are exposed calls for a rapid and effective response
            to accelerate the coverage of conservation efforts in the region.
